            <p>EA used to use a program called Origin to launch the Sims 4, amongst other games. Unfortunately, it often crashed. The way to resolve this was to clear the cache- which for a lot of people involved restarting their computer. To help with this, I wrote a simple batch program that could clean the cache whenever it was run. </p>
