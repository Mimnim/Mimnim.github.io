            During my final year at Aberystwyth University, I completed a major project. The CFS Pacing App aimed to be a calendar-like app to help people with Chronic fatigue track their energy levels. There was also intended to be an AI element that could look for patterns in the data, but due to time constraints, this was never implemented. Regardless, the steps to implementing such an AI are detailed in the report. The files were originally hosted on the university Gitlab, and have now been copied to my personal Gitlab<a

            "The goal of this project is to create a program that can help people with Chronic
            Fatigue Syndrome, also known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, to keep track of their
            energy levels and identify patterns in them." - Project Outline
