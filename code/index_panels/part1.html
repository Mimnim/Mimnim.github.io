            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>Software Design</p>
            <h3>Efficiency</h3>
            <p>We live in a world of short deadlines and rapid growth. Because of this, I understand the need for projects to be completed quickly and to a high standard. I write neat, short code, that is easily extendable, and well commented.</p>
            <h3>Agile Development</h3>
            <p> With a deep understanding of the Agile workflow, I implement it even when I am working by myself. This allows for a great deal of flexibility. Agile has an iterative approach, that enables the implementation of quick changes or pivots during development. </p>
