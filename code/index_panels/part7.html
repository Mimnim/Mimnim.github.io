        <div class="description" id="item1">Pricing is based on both the project's scope and your desired timeline. I tend to charge 20$-30$ per hour depending on the complexity. IT support is usually charged at around 15$ per hour.</div>

        For software design projects we’ll start with a quick meeting to discuss the scope and requirements. From there, the process will vary greatly from project to project. <br> For IT support, we’ll start with a meeting to discuss your current problem. I may make some initial suggestions, and then I’ll move on to helping you best I can. Many IT problems require me to be on-site to solve, so we’ll organise a time and place to meet.
