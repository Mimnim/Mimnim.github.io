        <h3>What are my prices?</h3>
        <p>Pricing is based on both the project's scope and your desired timeline. I tend to charge 20$-30$ per hour depending on the complexity. IT support is usually charged at around 15$ per hour.</p>
        
        <h3>What is your process?</h3>
        <p>For software design projects we’ll start with a quick meeting to discuss the scope and requirements. From there, the process will vary greatly from project to project. <br> For IT support, we’ll start with a meeting to discuss your current problem. I may make some initial suggestions, and then I’ll move on to helping you best I can. <br> Many IT problems require me to be on-site to solve, so we’ll organise a time and place to meet.</p>
