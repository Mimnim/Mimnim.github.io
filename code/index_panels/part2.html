            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>It Suport</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Problem</h3>
            <p>My degree in Computer Science and years of experience troubleshooting computers help me to quickly and efficiently identify problems. Email not working? Internet not connecting? Virus locking down your computer? Wedding Photos on a CD that is stuck in the CD player and won’t come out?  I have fixed all of these problems and more. </p>
            <h3>Connecting with the Customer</h3>
            <p>Computer problems can be extremely stressful. I understand this and aim to help keep the customer calm. I explain what is going on with their computer in lay-man’s terms, and the steps I am going to take to fix it. This helps the customer retain a degree of control in the process.</p>
