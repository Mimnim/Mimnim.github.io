            <p> As my major project for my undergraduate course, it was originally hosted on the aberyswyth univeristy gitlab. A copy of it can be found here(insert link). Whilst incomplete as it was realistaclly to large of an undertaking for such a short amount of time, I fele the report especially does a good job of showing my understanding of multiple areas, including planning, web design, data managment, lean kaban, and AI. </p>

            <img src="/assests/Origin_logo.png" alt="The Origin logo">
            <p>EA used to use a program called Origin to launch the Sims 4, amongst other games. Unfortunately, it often crashed. The way to resolve this was to clear the cache- which for a lot of people involved restarting their computer. To help with this, I wrote a simple batch program that could clean the cache whenever it was run. </p>
